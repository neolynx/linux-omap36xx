Adaptive Voltage Scaling (AVS) driver for Texas Instruments SoCs

Required Properties:
- compatible: "ti,avs"
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
- reg-names: Should contain the reg names
	- "base-address"	- contains base address of SmartReflex module
	- "efuse-address"	- contains base address, where specific setting are stored
- #address-cell: should be 0
- #size-cell: should be 0
- interrupts: Optional. Number of GIC interrupt used for SmartReflex
- ti,voltdm_name: name of corresponding voltage domain
- ti,ip_type: HW IP type. Should be one of:
	- 0x1
	- 0x2
- ti,senp_mod: P - sensor mode:
	- 0x0 sensor is disabled
	- 0x1 sensor is enabled
- ti,senn_mod: N - sensor mode:
	- 0x0 sensor is disabled
	- 0x1 sensor is enabled
- ti,err_weight: The AvgSenError weight
- ti,err_maxlimit: The upper limit of SenError for interrupt generation
- ti,accum_data: Number of Values to Accumulate
- ti,senn_avgweight: The weighting factor for the SenN averager
- ti,senp_avgweight: The weighting factor for the SenP averager
- ti,calibration_volt: defines voltage type for next calibration. Should be one of:
	- 0x1 - calibration should start from nominal voltage
	- 0x2 - calibration should start from voltage, retrieved from EFUSE register
	- 0x3 - calibration should start from pre-calibrated voltage
- ti,calibration_period
	- 0x1 - boot time calibration
	- 0x2 - periodic calibration
	- 0x3 - continuous calibration
	- 0x4 - calibration is disabled. AVS transfers voltage to PMIC
- ti,calibration_loop
	- 0x1 - hardware calibration loop (typically Voltage Processor) is used
	- 0x2 - software calibration loop is used
	- 0x3 - calibration loop is not used
- ti,recalibration_period: Optional. Recalibration period in milliseconds.
	Must be set only in case if ti,calibration_period property "periodic calibration".
- ti,fuse_len_24bits: Bool value
	On some OMAPs efuse registers can be 24-bit length
- ti,notify_flags: Optional. Should be defined if SmartReflex is going to use
	interrupts for calibration. Can be one of:
	- 0x1 - SR_NOTIFY_MCUACCUM
	- 0x2 - SR_NOTIFY_MCUVALID
	- 0x4 - SR_NOTIFY_MCUBOUND
	- 0x8 - SR_NOTIFY_MCUDISACK
- ti,autocomp_active: Bool value
	Defines is AVS autocompleteion should be activated immediately on
	driver probe
- ti,lvt_sensor: Optional. Defines is LVT sensor present on board or not
- ti,pmic_step_uv: Optional. Needed for software calibration loop
- ti,boot voltage: Optional. Defines boot voltage in case if
	ti,autocomp_active property is set to true
- ti,avs_info: An array of 5 or 6 tuples u32 items providing information about AVS
	configuration needed per operational voltage of the device.
	Each item consists of the following in the same order:
	volt: voltage in uV - Nominal voltage
	efuse: - offset for specific AVS settings per voltage
	errminlimit: - configuration setting for hardware per voltage
	errgain: - configuration setting for hardware per voltage
	volt_margin: - margin to be add for calibrated voltage
	efuse_lvt: - optional. Offset for LVT nvalue per voltage
